  const descAquaq = "I originally joined AquaQ as a kdb+ Graduate developer and in the first two months completed AquaQâ€™s in house training which consisted of kdb+, Linux and Financial training. I was then offered to move to work on a React.js based front-end project where my team is currently developing a web interface for a major global financial services client, where I actively contribute to the current sprint(s). In this time I have also studied and passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.";
  const descPolyloop = "Project lead designing and developing a new SaaS approach to strategically align policy and funding opportunities through developing an actionable framework with powerful insights. The project required self-learning d3.js, a data visualisation library to display complex and interactive models. The project was supported by a SQL database.";
  const descUSI = "Project lead developing and training a behaviour recognition model to detect custom behaviours in public space. The project required learning the YOLO (you only look once) computer vision library and training it with a custom dataset. The project was developed in Python.";
  const descQub = "Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. The degree covered mathematical modules such as Stochastic Calculus, Binomial Modules as well as Financial mathematics (Black-Scholes, Financial basics.) Over the years I also completed a Java group project (managed by GitLab) where we developed a card game, a MatLab computer vision group project where we trained a machine-learning algorithm. Other modules included C++ and a Python deep learning module. ";
  const descLCC = "During my A-Levels I took Mathematics, Physics and Software Systems Development. Over the two years, I developed a C# and SQL database application where users could create, update, read and delete their own data. I also developed a C# clone of Connect Four. Both projects had extensive testing and documentation and was approached with Agile methodology. These years were foundational to my coding understanding, especially object orientated programming.";
